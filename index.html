  	<h1>HTTP</h1>
	  <p>Short for HyperText Transfer Protocol, HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page. The other main standard that controls how the World Wide Web works is HTML, which covers how Web pages are formatted and displayed.</p>

	  <h1>History</h1>
	  <p>The term HyperText was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's vision (1930's) of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management "memex" system described in his essay As We May Think (1945). Tim Berners-Lee and his team are credited with inventing the original HTTP along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser. Berners-Lee first proposed the <i>"WorldWideWeb"</i> project in 1989 â€” now known as the World Wide Web.The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.</p>

	  <p>
	  The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9 (1991). Dave Raggett led the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG) in 1995 and wanted to expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.

	  In 2007, the HTTPbis Working Group was formed, in part, to revise and clarify the HTTP/1.1 spec. In June 2014, the WG released an updated six-part specification obsoleting:
	  <ul>
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing</li>
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content</li>	
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests</li>
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Range Requests</li>	
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Caching</li>
	  	<li>HTTP/1.1: Authentication</li>	

	  </ul>
